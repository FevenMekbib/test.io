 		<h2>Biography</h2>
 		<p>I'm Feven Mekbib, currently completing my final semester at Kennesaw State University, where I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration in Information Systems. Throughout my academic career at KSU, I've consistently demonstrated excellence, earning recognition on the Dean's List three times and the President's List four times. Remarkably, I've maintained high academic standards while simultaneously gaining extensive customer service experience through various roles. This blend of academic discipline and real-world job experience has equipped me with strong interpersonal skills, adaptability, and a practical understanding of workplace dynamics. Passionate about technology and eager to apply my skills in innovative environments, I'm excited to transition from the classroom to a professional tech setting.

 		<h2>Work Experience</h2>
 		<p>I began my professional journey as a Team Member at AMC, where I developed customer service and teamwork skills in a fast-paced environment. I then gained hands-on experience in both IT and administrative support as an IT Intern and Administrative Assistant at a small painting company, a role I held for nearly two years. To accommodate my academic schedule, I transitioned to Walmart, where I further strengthened my ability to manage customer interactions efficiently. I briefly worked at a voter warehouse, contributing to election operations, before taking on my current role at a family-owned grocery store, where I continue to build my customer service and operational skills.

 		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
 		<p>I have been riding motorcycles for about three years and enjoy taking rides whenever the weather is right. In my free time, I've started learning how to crochet, though I’m still a beginner. I also love swimming, working out, and cooking, which originally started as a way to meal prep. Music is a big part of my life, especially R&B and 2010s pop. I’m also eager to start traveling and exploring new places. Additionally, I enjoy learning new tech skills, such as creating websites, as I continue expanding my knowledge in the field.
